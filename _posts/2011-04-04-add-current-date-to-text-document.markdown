Often we need to add current date to text document. For Mac users we have such awesome tools as Automator and  AppleScript.
We need to do five simple steps:

__1)__ Create a new workflow with template "Service" in Automator

__2)__ Choose 'Service receives' to "no input" in "any application"

__3)__ Add action "Run AppleScript" with content:


{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
on run {input, parameters}
  tell application "System Events"
    keystroke (short date string of (current date))
  end tell
  return input
end run
{% endhighlight %}

__4)__ Save the service

__5)__ Go To "System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Services" and setup a shortcut for the service and enable it.
