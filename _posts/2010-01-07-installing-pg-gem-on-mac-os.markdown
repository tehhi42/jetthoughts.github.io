I have Mac OS Snow Leopard which has arch x86_64. But when I tried install postgres gem for this arch I had errors, such as:

```ruby
compat.h:38:2: error: #error PostgreSQL client version too old, requires 7.3 or later.
```

So I install postgres(pg) gem for i386 arch:

```ruby
export ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386'
PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin:/usr/bin:/bin /usr/bin/gem install pg -- --with-pgsql-config=/Library/PostgreSQL/8.4/bin/pg_config
```
